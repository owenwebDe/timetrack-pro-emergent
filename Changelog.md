- ‚úÖ **Origin validation**: Better CORS configuration
- ‚úÖ **Error responses**: More descriptive error messages
- ‚úÖ **Development logging**: Enhanced logging for debugging

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Fixes Applied**

#### **Backend Fixes (`/backend`)**

```javascript
// Fixed Rate Limiting
const authLimiter = createRateLimit(
  15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  10, // INCREASED: 10 attempts (was 5)
  "Too many authentication attempts"
);

const generalLimiter = createRateLimit(
  1 * 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  200, // INCREASED: 200 requests (was 100)
  "Too many requests"
);

// Fixed JWT Token Generation
const token = jwt.sign(
  {
    id: user.id,
    email: user.email,
    role: user.role,
    organizationId: user.organizationId, // ADDED: Organization context
  },
  process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  { expiresIn: process.env.JWT_EXPIRE || "7d" }
);
```

#### **Frontend Fixes (`/frontend`)**

```javascript
// Fixed Token Storage
if (response.data.token) {
  localStorage.setItem("hubstaff_token", response.data.token);
  localStorage.setItem("authToken", response.data.token);
  console.log("‚úÖ Token stored successfully");
}

// Fixed API Client with Better Error Handling
const token =
  localStorage.getItem("hubstaff_token") ||
  localStorage.getItem("authToken") ||
  localStorage.getItem("token");

if (token && token !== "undefined" && token !== "null") {
  config.headers.Authorization = `Bearer ${token}`;
}
```

### üìã **Testing Results**
