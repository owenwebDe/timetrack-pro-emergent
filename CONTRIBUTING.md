## üìã Development Guidelines

### Code Style

#### Python (Backend)
```python
# Use type hints
def create_project(project_data: ProjectCreate, user_id: str) -> Project:
    """Create a new project for the user."""
    pass

# Use descriptive variable names
def calculate_productivity_score(
    activity_level: float, 
    hours_worked: float,
    target_hours: float
) -> float:
    """Calculate productivity score based on activity and hours."""
    pass
```

#### JavaScript/React (Frontend)
```javascript
// Use descriptive component names
const ProjectCard = ({ project, onEdit, onDelete }) => {
  // Component logic here
};

// Use hooks properly
const useTimeTracking = () => {
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
  const [duration, setDuration] = useState(0);
  
  // Hook logic here
  
  return { isRunning, duration, start, stop };
};
```

### Database Guidelines

- Use proper indexes for performance
- Validate data at the model level
- Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries
- Handle errors gracefully

```python
# Good: Using aggregation for analytics
pipeline = [
    {"$match": {"user_id": user_id}},
    {"$group": {"_id": "$project_id", "total_hours": {"$sum": "$duration"}}},
    {"$sort": {"total_hours": -1}}
]
```

### API Guidelines

- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive error messages
- Add request/response validation
- Document all endpoints

```python
@router.post("/projects", response_model=Project, status_code=201)
async def create_project(
    project_data: ProjectCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
):
    """
    Create a new project.
    
    Args:
        project_data: Project creation data
        current_user: Currently authenticated user
        
    Returns:
        Created project object
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: If project creation fails
    """
```

### UI/UX Guidelines

- Maintain responsive design
- Use consistent color scheme and spacing
- Provide loading states for async operations
- Include proper error handling and user feedback
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)
